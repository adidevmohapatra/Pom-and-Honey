# Web-Based Pom and Honey POS System
## Project 3 by Team 62
We are developing a world-changing web 3.0 application created with the latest technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and NodeJS.
Essentially, we are revolutionizing the restaurant industry with a state-of-the-art automated POS system for the wildly popular and critically acclaimed restaurant Pom and Honey, located at the Memorial Student Center, the heart of Texas A&M University in College Station.
Our system will serve customers, servers, and managers. 

## How to Run
First, obtain top-level security clearance from the NSA, FBI, and CSI. Clearly you have already done this
since you are reading this text.

Next, clone this repository onto your computer, and run `npm install`

Then, set up a .env file in the root directory with the database credentials.
Specifically, you will need to set `PGHOST`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`, and `PGPASSWORD`.
These credentials should have been provided to you by the NSA. If you still need them,
please contact NSA Director General Paul M. Nakasone at nsahomie@nsa.gov

You will also need to set `PORT` to the desired port and `DEVMODE` to `true`.

Finally, run `node index.js`
